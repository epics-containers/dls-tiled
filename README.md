# dls_tiled

Tiled server with Diamond Light Source plugins

The upstream [Tiled](https://blueskyproject.io/tiled/) server image
(`ghcr.io/bluesky/tiled`) with Diamond Light Source plugins added to its
environment. Tiled itself is unmodified; the image is a drop-in replacement for
the upstream one in the [bluesky tiled helm chart](https://github.com/bluesky/tiled/tree/main/helm/tiled).

## Plugins

Plugins are FastAPI routers. Enable one by listing it under `routers:` in the
tiled server config.

### `dls_tiled.visr:visr_router`

`GET /api/v1/binned/{uid}` bins a ViSR scan into a 2-D image on the server and
returns the mean `RedTotal`, `GreenTotal` and `BlueTotal` in each bin as
matrices with one row per y bin and one column per x bin (`null` where no point
landed), the bin edges as `x_limits` and `y_limits`, and `n_points`/`n_total`,
the points used so far and the points the scan will have (`null` without a
spec). Positions come from the recorded readbacks, or from the ScanSpec
setpoints in the run's start document with `setpoints=true`.

Unless `width`/`height` or a full `xmin`/`xmax`/`ymin`/`ymax` range are given,
the bins follow the scan's setpoint grid from its spec (one cell per setpoint,
fixed from the first poll), provided the spec is a grid of at least 3×3 and the
recorded positions lie on it; otherwise numpy's default 10×10 over the data.
Other query parameters: `x_dim_index`, `y_dim_index` and the repeatable
`slice_dim=dim:center:thickness`.

A file still behind the catalog is retried briefly and then answered with 503
and `Retry-After`. Identical requests share one result for a short while and
carry an `ETag`, so a repeated poll of an unchanged image gets a `304`.

| Environment variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `DLS_TILED_VISR_NOT_READY_RETRIES` | `3` | retries before answering 503 |
| `DLS_TILED_VISR_NOT_READY_RETRY_DELAY` | `0.2` | seconds between those retries |
| `DLS_TILED_VISR_CACHE_SECONDS` | `0.5` | how long a result is shared; `0` turns sharing off |
| `DLS_TILED_VISR_MAX_GRID_CELLS` | `100000` | largest scan grid used by default |

```yaml
routers:
  - dls_tiled.visr:visr_router
```

## Logging

tiled's default logging config has no handler for the plugin loggers, so their
INFO messages are dropped. The image includes `/deploy/log_config.yml`, which is
tiled's default plus the `dls_tiled` loggers. Select it by overriding the
container command, e.g. with the tiled helm chart:

```yaml
args: [tiled, serve, config, --host, 0.0.0.0, --port, "8000", --scalable,
       --log-config, /deploy/log_config.yml]
```

## Tiled version

`TILED_VERSION` at the top of the `Dockerfile` selects the upstream release.
The image build fails if installing the plugins would change that version.
